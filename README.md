## üö´ Topics Not Covered in This Repository

While this project provides a comprehensive and clean implementation of the classic Pac-Man game using the Entity Component System (ECS) pattern and modern C# practices, it intentionally does not cover certain advanced or unrelated topics, including but not limited to:

- **Graphics Programming and Rendering:** This project uses a console-based UI powered by Spectre.Console and does not delve into graphics programming, GPU rendering, or game engine graphics pipelines.
- **Advanced Game Physics:** There is no physics engine or complex collision detection beyond simple grid-based movement and collision.
- **Networking and Multiplayer:** The game is single-player and does not include any networking or multiplayer features.
- **Audio Programming:** Sound effects or music are not implemented.
- **Artificial Intelligence Beyond Basic Ghost Movement:** The ghost AI is basic and does not include advanced pathfinding or machine learning.
- **Platform-Specific Optimizations:** The code is designed for cross-platform console applications and does not include platform-specific optimizations or native integrations.

This focus allows the repository to remain a clear and educational resource for learning ECS, clean code, and C# console application development.

## üö¶ Test-Driven Development (TDD) in This Repository
### What is TDD?
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where you:

- Write a failing test that describes a small piece of desired functionality.

- Write the minimum code needed to make the test pass.

- Refactor the code, keeping all tests green.

- Repeat for each new feature or improvement.

TDD helps you:

- Focus on clear, testable requirements.

- Catch bugs early.

- Encourage modular, maintainable code.

- Build confidence to refactor and extend your codebase.

## üèÉ TDD in Action: Implementing the Warp Feature
Let's demonstrate TDD using the warp tunnel feature from Pac-Man.

### Step 1: Write a Failing Test
First, we write a test that describes the desired behavior:
When the player or a ghost moves onto a warp tile, they should appear at the matching warp tile on the same row.

For this, we need to add some logic to the `MazeService`.

Start by implementing the test, which will fail, because we didn't implement `MazeService.TryGetWarpDestination` yet.

```csharp
[Test]
public void TryGetWarpDestination_Returns_CorrectDestination_WhenWarpPortalContainsSourceAndDestination()
{
    // Arrange: add two warp entities in row 5 at (0,5) and (27,5)
    var leftWarp = _world.CreateEntity();
    _world.AddComponent(leftWarp, new WarpPortalComponent());
    _world.AddComponent(leftWarp, new PositionComponent((0, 5)));
    var rightWarp = _world.CreateEntity();
    _world.AddComponent(rightWarp, new WarpPortalComponent());
    _world.AddComponent(rightWarp, new PositionComponent((27, 5)));

    var mazeService = new MazeService(_world);

    // Act
    var result = mazeService.TryGetWarpDestination(0, 5, out var newPos);

    // Assert: newPos should be (27,5) and result should be true
    result.Should().BeTrue();
    newPos.Should().Be((27, 5));
}
```

### Step 2: Implement the Minimum Code to Pass the Test
Now, implement the warp logic in MazeService so the tests pass:

```csharp
public bool TryGetWarpDestination(int x, int y, out (int x, int y) destination)
{
    // Find all warp entities in the same row
    var warpEntities = world.GetEntitiesWith<WarpPortalComponent>()
        .Select(world.GetComponent<PositionComponent>)
        .Where(component => component.Position.Y == y)
        .ToList();
    
    destination = (x, y);
    if (warpEntities.Count < 2)
        return false; // No warp or only one warp in this row

    // Find the other warp position in the same row
    destination = warpEntities
        .Select(component => (component.Position.X, component.Position.Y))
        .FirstOrDefault(pos => pos.X != x);
    
    return destination != default;
}
```

Run the tests again‚Äîthey should now pass (green).

### Step 3: Refactor and Extend
With the tests green, you can safely refactor or extend the feature, knowing the tests will catch regressions.

## üßë‚Äçüíª How to Practice TDD in This Repository
- Add a test for every new feature or bug fix before writing the implementation.

- Run the tests to see them fail.

- Write the minimal code to make the test pass.

- Refactor as needed, keeping all tests green.

- Commit your tests and implementation together.

This workflow helps ensure robust, maintainable, and well-documented code.

TDD is not just a technique‚Äîit's a mindset that leads to better design and higher confidence in your code. Give it a try as you contribute or experiment with this Pac-Man project!

## üó∫Ô∏è Maze Configuration using a simple text file

The structure and layout of the Pac-Man maze in this project are defined in an external, human-readable file called `maze.txt`. This file allows you to easily design, modify, or extend the maze without changing any code.

### How `maze.txt` Works

Each line in `maze.txt` represents a row in the maze. Each character in a line represents a cell at a specific (x, y) coordinate in the grid. The file is parsed at game startup, and the contents are used to generate the maze entities and features via the ECS.

#### **Legend: Maze Symbols**

| Symbol  | Meaning                                                        |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `#`     | Wall                                                           |
| `.`     | Dot (collectable)                                              |
| `@`     | Warp tunnel (teleport from one `@` to another in the same row) |
| (space) | Empty cell (walkable, no dot)                                  |
| other   | (Reserved for future features, e.g. power pellets)             |

#### **Example `maze.txt`**

See [maze.txt](src/PacMan.Game/maze.txt)

#### **How the Maze is Used**

- **Walls** (`#`): Entities with a `WallComponent` and a `PositionComponent` are created at these positions. These block movement.
- **Dots** (`.`): Entities with a `DotComponent` and a `PositionComponent` are created at these positions. These are collectable by the player.
- **Warp Tunnels** (`@`): When the player or a ghost moves onto a warp tunnel, they are instantly moved to the matching `@` in the same row, allowing classic Pac-Man wrap-around movement.
- **Empty Spaces**: Open paths for movement, no entity is created.

#### **Extending the Maze**

You can edit `maze.txt` to:
- Change the maze shape and size.
- Add or remove dots and walls.
- Place warp tunnels (`@`) wherever you want wrap-around movement.
- Reserve other symbols for future features (e.g., power pellets, fruits, ghost house).

#### **How the File is Loaded**

At game startup, the maze file is read by the `MazeConfigurationLoader`, which parses each character and records the positions of walls, dots, and warps. These positions are then used to create the corresponding entities in the ECS world.

## üå± Suggestions for Extensions & New Features

This project is a great starting point for learning, but there are many ways to extend it‚Äîboth to more closely match the original Pac-Man gameplay and to explore advanced ECS concepts. Here are some ideas for further development:

---

### üïπÔ∏è Classic Gameplay Features

- **Power Pellets / Energizers**  
  Add large dots ("power pellets") that let Pac-Man eat ghosts for a short time, as in the original game.
- **Ghost AI Personalities**  
  Implement unique movement patterns for each ghost (Blinky, Pinky, Inky, Clyde) to mimic their original behaviors.
- **Bonus Fruits & Items**  
  Occasionally spawn bonus items (fruits) for extra points.
- **Multiple Levels & Increasing Difficulty**  
  Advance to new mazes or increase ghost speed as the player progresses.

- **Sound Effects**  
  Add simple sound cues for eating dots, power pellets, ghosts, and losing lives.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Additional ECS & Advanced Features

- **Component Pooling**  
  Implement a pool for frequently created/destroyed components to improve performance and reduce garbage collection.
- **Event System**  
  Add an event or messaging system for decoupled communication between systems (e.g., "Pac-Man ate power pellet" event).
- **System Scheduling/Prioritization**  
  Allow systems to run in a specific order or only when needed.
- **Entity Queries**  
  Support more flexible queries (e.g., all entities with Position and Velocity, but without Stunned).
- **Prefab/Blueprint System**  
  Define reusable templates for entities (e.g., different ghost types or maze layouts).
- **Serialization & Save/Load**  
  Save and restore game state (entities and components) for persistence or debugging.
- **Inspector/Debug Console**  
  Add a debug view to inspect entities, components, and systems at runtime.
- **Component Removal Events**  
  Allow systems to react when components are removed from entities.

---

### üí° Other Learning and Experimentation Ideas

- **Multithreaded Systems**  
  Explore running independent systems in parallel for performance.
- **Dependency Injection**  
  Use DI to further decouple systems and improve testability.
- **UI Improvements**  
  Add menus, pause screens, or settings using Spectre.Console's advanced widgets.
- **Port to GUI**  
  Try porting the ECS core to a GUI framework (like Avalonia, WinForms, or Unity) to see how the architecture scales.
- **AI or Bot Player**  
  Implement a simple AI to play Pac-Man or control ghosts for testing.
